# AblationPlanner

Radio Frequency Ablation Planner


Input 
  - CT scan data of the patient liver (volume) 
  - A clone of the previous data volume (volume) 
  - Segmentation of the liver and tumor for better visualization (not mandatory) 
  
  
This module allows users to select ablation points within the tumor, set a burning time and observe the volume that is affected. Visualized with the isodose slicerRT extension, the user can visualize the hypothesized heat dose distribution.
